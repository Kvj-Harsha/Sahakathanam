# 📖 సహకథనం (Sahakathanam)

A collaborative storytelling web app where users take turns writing story segments in Indian languages, starting with Telugu.

---

## 🧠 Idea

**Sahakathanam** is a chain-story builder designed to collect natural narrative text in regional languages. One user starts a story with a few lines, and others continue it, one segment at a time. Each contribution is stored locally (offline-first) and can be synced later for corpus collection.

## 🛣️ Project Roadmap

This app is structured in 3 progressive phases, starting from a minimal offline-capable collector to a fully AI-augmented storytelling engine.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Basic Corpus Collector (MVP)

> 🕐 Timeline: Day 1

- Build a functional collaborative story-writing tool.
- Multilingual story creation (starting with Telugu).
- Offline-first: stories can be written without internet.
- Local JSON storage.
- Manual corpus upload/sync when network is available.

**Tech Used:**
- Streamlit
- Python 3
- JSON file storage
- Hugging Face Spaces for deployment

---

### 🤖 Phase 2: Light ML/NLP Enhancements

> 🕐 Timeline: Week 2

- Detect the language used in each input (e.g., Telugu, Hindi).
- Tag segments as "narrative" or "dialogue".
- Add metadata to each story segment to improve corpus quality.

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "text": "ఒక ఊరిలో చిన్నారి ఉండేది.",
  "type": "narrative",
  "lang_detected": "te"
}
